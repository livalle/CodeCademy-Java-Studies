/* Good practices and basics in Java:
int, which stores whole numbers.
double, which stores bigger whole numbers and decimal numbers.
boolean, which stores true and false.
char, which stores single characters using single quotes.
String, which stores multiple characters using double quotes.
Static typing, which is one of the safety features of Java.
Variable naming conventions.*/

    It also, should start with only letters,$ or _ ,
    and using camelCase for good practice and good quality of code. */

  double desiredSalary = 4.000; //In other hand, double is used for storing decimal numbers like : 3.4  22.3 etc...
    
   char gender = 'F'; /*char is a single character holder that must always be followed with a '' 
   differently from String it only holds a single character and nothing else */
